The SUA touch directory is an ongoing effort and has benefited from
contributions by numerous designers and developers.

Zach Johnson created original concepts, design, and usability for the project.
He led implementation on the original first floor directory Coffman Union in
2009-2010.

Ken Loomis and Tony Thomas continued to improve the interface since then, added
two more directories in Coffman Union, implemented a directory interface for
the St. Paul Student Center, and ported the PHP codebase to Python in March
2014.

Trent Raygor installed, configured, and deployed all hardware and system
settings for the machines.

Major student contributors have included:

- Kamran Ayub
- Ellie Drotning
- Ethan Poole
- Ben Demaree
- Savina Proykova
